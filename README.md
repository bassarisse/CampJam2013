Office Rampage is a game made for [CampJam 13](http://www.gamux.com.br/campjam/edicoes/2013/) *within 48 hours*. The jam theme was "Coffee". :)

It's a fast paced running survival, in which an office became totally ravaged by the addiction to caffeine. The workers transformed into brainiac zombies, possessing only one object: drink more coffee.
You're the company's intern, and as always arrived late at the job. But to prove yourself and finally get hired, you must keep on doing the (very) important task of making copies.


Gameplay: basic mechanics
---------------------
You can move using either the keyboard or the mouse. 
You have two gauges that measures the caffeine level and the health of the player.
The more caffeine, the more speed.
By reaching a certain amount of caffeine, the player begins to take health damage, and gets closer to being one of the addicted workers.

You must survive the addicion as long as possible to accumulate more score.
By taking xerox copies, you gain bonus score.


Gameplay: pickups
---------------------

By picking up the items on the ground you absorb its' effects:
-   Coffee: can be picked up by either the player or the workers. Increases the movement speed of the unit, but adding more caffeine to its' users organisms.
-   Water bottle: reduces the caffeine level of the player.
-   Donut: Heals the player.
-   Peaberry Coffee: increases the speed of the unit without increasing the caffeine level.


Gameplay: workers
---------------------

There are 3 types of randomly spawned units in the map, and they are dangerous to the player. By touching them, the player takes damage. Each type of worker causes a specific amount of damage.
The workers also have the ability to pick up coffees around the map and become faster, but they get incapacitated when drinking too much. ;)


Gameplay: copying
---------------------

The map contains four checkpoints that allows the players to make copies and deliver them to the boss.
A copy consists of getting a blank paper, a filled one, taking them to the copy machine and then to the boss' desk.
